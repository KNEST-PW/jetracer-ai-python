In this repo I provide you with Jupyter notebooks as well as standalone python files for:
1. steering car with controller using pygame
2. steering car with controller using ipwidgets
3. controlling LIDAR and simple mapping
  
examples are provided in english and polish in thier respective folders
## Instructions  
1. follow istruction on [Jetracer site](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/JetRacer_AI_Kit) until you reach Jupyter terminal
2. add my Jupyter notebooks to /Jetracer/notebooks
## Why not use provided examples?
1. my robot bought on Botland didn't come with working examples on teleoperation
2. I provided more examples - like LIDAR

---
In this repo I provide you with Jupyter notebooks as well as standalone python files for:
1. steering car with controller using pygame
2. steering car with controller using ipwidgets
3. controlling LIDAR and simple mapping
  
examples are provided in english and polish in thier respective folders.  

## Instructions  
Follow instructions in [instrukcje_uruchomienia.md](https://github.com/M1chol/jetracer-ai-kit-python/blob/dev/instrukcje_uruchomienia.md)
## Why not use provided examples?
1. my robot bought on Botland didn't come with working examples on teleoperation
2. I provided more examples - like LIDAR
